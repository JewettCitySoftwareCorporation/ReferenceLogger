This is a minimal tray application to help you Logg, Tag & Manage References

The goal is being able to sort by Tags, Date Stamps, Domains, Topics, keywords, descriptons, titles and all sorts-ed information gathered.

Then enable the user to extract this data in a HUMAN usable fashion & machine readable exports, but if you code to the end point...??


I hope you enjoy this product, if you got thoughts for improvments reach out.
