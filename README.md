Built this application based on 2 Open Source Projects and idea specific business logic.

This is a minimal tray application to help you logg, Tag, Manage referances

The goal is being able to sort by Tags, Date Stamps, Domains, Topics, keywords, descriptons, titles and all sorts-ed information gathered.

Then enable the user to extract this data in a HUMAN usable fashion & machine readable exports, but if you code to the end point...??


I hope you enjoy this product, if you got thoughts for improvments reach out.

**Clone, Merge and run for a quick way to see Electron in action putting BPHT5 to use to help you build better user components.  I can't tell every one it was that easy, but you made it this far.**



        
**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
